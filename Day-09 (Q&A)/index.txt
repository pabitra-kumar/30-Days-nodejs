Which of the following are examples of node modules?
a. Express
b. Body-parser
c. Socket.io
d. All of the above


In the context of Node.js, modules are essentially reusable pieces of code that can be organized and encapsulated to perform specific functionalities. Let's go through each of the options:

a. Express: Express is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs by providing a set of features and utilities. It handles routing, middleware, and other functionalities, making it easier to create robust and scalable web applications.

b. Body-parser: Body-parser is a middleware for Express that extracts the body of an incoming HTTP request and exposes it in a more convenient format, such as JSON. It is commonly used to handle data submitted through forms or sent in JSON format.

c. Socket.io: Socket.io is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers. It provides an abstraction for working with WebSockets, allowing developers to build applications that can push real-time updates to connected clients. It is commonly used in applications that require instant data updates, such as chat applications or live collaboration tools.

Now, let's address the question:

d. All of the above: Yes, all the options (Express, Body-parser, and Socket.io) are examples of Node modules. They are independent packages that can be installed using npm (Node Package Manager) and used to enhance the functionality of a Node.js application.

In summary, the correct answer is d. All of the above.
